 # 🏏 IPL Match Performance Analysis Dashboard (2020–2025)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of IPL (Indian Premier League) matches from 2020 to 2025. Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I cleaned, queried, and visualized match performance data to highlight team strengths, top-performing players, and venue-based trends.

The final result is an interactive Power BI dashboard that offers a detailed breakdown of runs, wickets, boundaries, and powerplay performance. The dashboard allows users to explore IPL data across years, teams, and venues in a single page.

The goal is to provide a clear, data-driven summary of IPL match performance for fans, analysts, and non-technical users.
